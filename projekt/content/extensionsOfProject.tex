\begin{description}
\item[Multiple motes] If there are multiple sensing motes, they send their sensing data to the sink.
\item[Plotting] Plot temperature vs. time (offline /online)
\item[Temperature average] The sink averages the temperature from the sensors.
\item[Temperature average sensor] The sensor motes averages $n$ temperatures before sending to the sink to improve energy efficiency of the application.
\item[Temperature average improved] Motes averages temperature sends number of recorded temperatures which indicates what weight the sink should use to make a correct average.
\item[Temperature motes] overvej om temp motes skal kunne modtage

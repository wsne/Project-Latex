\section{Project Description}

In the following project we've made a sensor network which can measure the
temperature periodically. The sensor motes will transmit their results
(different strategies will be covered and discussed in the extension part) to
the sink which indicates the temperature by either a blue ($\leq 15^{\circ} C
$) or a red $>15^{\circ} C$.

To make sure that the sink has received the packages the sink will send an ACK
to the sensing mote, if the sink receives the sensing data correctly. After
receiving an ACK the sensing mote goes to sleep, if not it receives an ACK it
will try to retransmit $N$ times.

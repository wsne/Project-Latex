\section{Project results}
After have done the implementaion we've been making some measurements with our
temperature sensor mote. From these measurements there is made a single graph,
\ref{fig:results} with shows the sensor's temperature. The figure show also
that, as earlier described that the temperature is multiplied by $100$.
Therefore it's clear to see that the data in the figure are more fine grain in
the graph, and it gives a more linear impression.

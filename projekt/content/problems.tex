\section{Problems}
In this project we've had several problems with the teleosb mote, and the tinyos which we're using on the motes. We took a shortcut in this and used some examples which follow with the tinyos distribution for example the oscilliscope, which also includes standard java problems,  and the basestation projects. This introduced some problems since the basestation had some compile time flags which made it no to send any acknowledments on received packages. Since this was a part of the project description, it was quite annoying and took a lot of time to figure out that this flag was the problem 

We've had several problems with missing documentation of some specific tinyos features and description of what it does in some scenarios, so we were forced to try it out to see what happend. 

One thing we would have liked to have implemented is that the sink would only consider packages which was for the sink. Since our motes are unicasting to the sink, and we had a fixed number of motes this could be easily implemented, we thought. The tinyos has a call where one can check if the package: \emph{is for me}. The problem was If the mote received a broadcast then it can't ignore it, because broadcast message would always return true in the is for me call. And there wasn't any other way to adjust this, and since many of the other students broadcasted their messages, this meant our sink got a lot of garbage.

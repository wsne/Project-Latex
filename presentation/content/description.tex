\frametitle{Description}

\begin{itemize}
	\item make a  sensor network which can measure the temperature periodically
	\item Sensor mote transmit results to sink
	\item Sensor shows the results by either:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item a blue ($\leq 15^{\circ} C $) led
		\item or a red $>15^{\circ} C$ led 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Sink sends ACK to sensor mote if receives package
	\item Sensor mote goes to sleep if receives ACK or try to retransmit $N$ times.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Multiple motes] If there are multiple sensing motes, they send their sensing data to the sink.
\item[Plotting] Plot temperature vs. time (offline /online)
\item[Temperature average] The sink averages the temperature from the sensors.
\item[Temperature average sensor] The sensor motes averages $n$ temperatures before sending to the sink to improve energy efficiency of the application.
\item[Temperature average improved] Motes averages temperature sends number of recorded temperatures which indicates what weight the sink should use to make a correct average.
